- Reset 3, 5, 7 player setup to match game board layout in the rules reference (e.g. for 3 players, 1 on "south" side of the table, 2 "north").  This also matches what most map generators produce for those player counts.
- Map tool right click option to rotate map 180 degrees.
- Update map strings for 3p and 5p maps for the new orientation, added hyperlanes to map strings.
- Strategy card automator in tool bag (thanks Jirach08).  [This is cool, check it out.]
- Build tool AI Dev Algorithm now only includes each unit upgrade once (if copied).
- Mech unit bags now reject non-mechs.
- Update "Produce en Masse" to have "PRODUCTION" instead of "Production".
- Mirage now attaches further from center for less overlap with center wormholes.
- Updated PoK Franken bag home system tiles (thanks Jefferson).
- Setup tile now rotates slowly during setup to signal setup is still in progress.
- Combat roller now restricts unit modifier messages to combat related modifiers.
- Update in-game notebook, some small tweaks and new PoK section.
- Added mouseover text to Naaz-Rokha mech with ground/space combat handling.
