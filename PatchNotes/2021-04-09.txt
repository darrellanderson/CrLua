- Fix exploration drawing multiple copies of the gamma wormhole token.
- Fix build area tool production values for infantry and fighters when Yin and Naalu commanders are active (and verify stacks correctly with "Regulated Conscription").
- Franken Box now looks inside "Faction Pack" bags on the table as well as main "Factions" bag (e.g. Blue Space).
- Milty draft tool now includes the how-to-use image on the back (alt-shift view).
