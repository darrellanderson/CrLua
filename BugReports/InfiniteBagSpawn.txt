TTS BUG REPORT

Spawning populated infinite bags sometimes positions the floating contained item in the wrong place.
Note: this bug appears to be per-player, as host as I have not seen it but in-game players have (and submitted screenshots).

This has happened in three cases:

(1) Using unrelatedBag.takeObject with smooth=true to take an infinite bag.  The contained object appeared near where the take originated instead of the final position.

(2) Using infiniteBag.getJSON followed by spawnObjectJSON.  The contained object appeared where it was for the saved JSON, not at the new spawn position.

(3) Using infiniteBag.clone.  The contained object appeared above the expected position.

To reiterate this does not always happen.  I have been able to reliably reproduce it with a remote second player, both host and second player have high-end systems.

Screenshots:

- Cloned bag, token above expected position.
- getJson/spawnObjectJson token is at the saved bag location, bag "appears" empty but is functional.
