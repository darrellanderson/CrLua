v15.1:
- Fix attachments not working for 4 planets (name collision with "hybrid franken systems"; removed the hybrid tiles from variants bag).
- "Place cards" now places legendary planet cards as well.
- Exploration cards now have a "purge card" right click menu option (attached tokens express the effect).
- New unit stand (thanks @3tamatulg (UK) ).
- Added ids for strategy card buttons for interested listeners.
- Make the Titan attach token images circles to look better on planet cards.
